        <p>Barack Obama once said <q>Use the q tag to put quotations in html</q></p>
        <p>One time Obama even told the Washington Post: 
            <blockquote>In order to put a quote that's longer than a couple sentences, you have to use the blockquote tag.<br>
             The blockquote tag is especially useful so that you don't need to put all the indents and do all the formatting <br>
             yourself. Don't sleep on the blockquote tag fool. The <abbr title = "Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr> won't let me be or let me be me so let me <br>
             see, they tried to shut me down on MTV, but it feels so empty without me.</blockquote></p>
